        <p class="text-light-emphasis w-75 fs-4">Thank you for visiting my website! Up until recently, I was an occupational therapist, and I had studied
          chemistry at the college and graduate school level. I decided to learn about the technologies that are crucial to the web when I realized I use it
          every day, but didn't know how it worked under the hood! The more I learned about these technologies, the more respect I had for
          their function and the work that goes into them. I have now decided to put my full time in becoming a web
          developer and I hope to make my mark on the web soon!
